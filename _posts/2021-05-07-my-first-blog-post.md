## This is the first blog

I'm currently reading *Life, The Universe and Everything* by Douglas Adams accompanied by it's audiobook read by him.

I've read the first two installments of the series by him-*The Hitchhiker's Guide to the Galaxy* and *The Restaurant at the End of the Universe*- by him too.
They've been really fun to read and I hope to read all books in the series soon!
